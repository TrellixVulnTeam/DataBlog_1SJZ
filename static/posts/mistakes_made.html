<h1> Mistakes Were Made: Getting Over a Few Linux Pitfalls</h1> <br><br />
If you're like me and just starting to learn how to use Linux, the experience can be somewhat frustrating. Sometimes you
 type something in Bash, and suddenly see a GUI in the console that you don't know how to get out of. Or when you're using
  a server and your script that works fine on your own device crashes every time you try to run it. So I'm going to mention
   a few mistakes I've made and how to fix them.<br />
<br />
1. sudo pip install ... (while being a 'user', not 'root') - I'm trying to build a website from scratch, and when I was
 trying to run the code I kept getting this error:<br />
<br />
"import error: cannot import flask"<br />
<br />
I knew what it mean, but I didn't understand. I had already pip installed it! If I ran python, and imported it there, I 
didn't run into any problems. As it turned out, it was installed, but just for one user. The code that was being ran
was from the 'root' user, and not 'username'. So it would look in the root user directory and wouldn't find the script.
<br></br>
 There are a few ways to fix this problem. The easy way (and what worked for me)
 is installing it to the user that will be running the script (such as root). To do so I simply typed 'sudo su' (which
 gives me access to the root user) and then ran the pip install command again.
  After that, everything worked smoothly.<br />
<br />
2. This inescapable screen after typing 'git commit' (after leaving out the message):<br />

<br />
As it turns out, I was in 'vim', which is actually a very popular editor to Unix users, but for someone used to a fancy 
IDE, it was frightening. I tried pressing escape. Nothing. Tried a few other commands I recognize, and still was not
 successful. So I closed out Bash and pretended nothing had happened. I made the commitment that I would always remember 
 '-m "my message"' so I would never get stuck again. But, as might be expected, I forgot again. And again. Eventually 
 someone pointed out to me that there is a way out.<br />
<br />
First, press 'i' so that you can insert. After writing the commit message you want, press 'esc'. Then type ':wq', 
which tells vim to quite and save the changes. Then your commit should be successful.
