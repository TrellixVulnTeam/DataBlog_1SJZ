    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="lead">I am a data scientist with one year of experience in machine learning, and 
                four years in cognitive neuroscience research. I love to use the tools of data science to gain insights
                into the world around me, especially when those make the world a better place. I am currently looking
                for a position as a junior data scientist, so if your company could benefit from an up-and-coming data 
                scientist, I would love to hear from you.
