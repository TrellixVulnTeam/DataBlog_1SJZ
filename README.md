# DataBlog

I'm working on developing my own blog website with Flask, so here I have code working up to that. I have some exciting plans with
this page, and updates will be coming frequently. One of the first projects for this blog will be a system where it analyzes news feeds
and tries to predict whether the feed is "liberal", "conservative", or other. It's time for me to improve my deep learning techniques,
so this project will use it.
